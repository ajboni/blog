Hello once again internet people.

After [last year template](https://pointbleepstudios.com/2017/12/01/orchestral-scoring-reaper-template-100-free-70-tracks/) I was suggested another great free (and open-source!) collections of  orchestral samples. So I decided, why not, lets make a new template and  see what we got. 

As always the idea is only use free plugins.
The  template is super handy to quickly test ideas and why not write whole  pieces with it. 

<!-- more -->
For this year edition we will need:

- [Reaper (duh)](https://reaper.fm)
- [Plogue’s Sforzando](https://www.plogue.com/downloads/)
- The wonderful [VSCO 2.1.1: COMMUNITY Ed.](https://github.com/sgossner/VSCO-2-CE/tree/SFZ) from [Versilian Studios](http://vis.versilstudios.net/)[Ivy](http://ivyaudio.com/Piano-in-162)
